In computer science, the Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string-searching
algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.
It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of
a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text.
It matches all strings simultaneously. The complexity of the algorithm
is linear in the length of the strings plus the length of the searched
text plus the number of output matches. Note that because all matches
are found, there can be a quadratic number of matches if every substring
matches (e.g. dictionary = a, aa, aaa, aaaa and input string is aaaa).
